Command line utility for updating GitHub commit statuses and enabling required status checks for pull requests.

* https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses
* https://help.github.com/articles/enabling-required-status-checks

Useful for CI environments to set more specific commit and build statuses, including setting the target URL
(the URL of the page representing the build status, or the URL of the deployed application).

### Build the Go program locally

```sh
go get

CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -v -o "./dist/bin/github-status-updater" *.go
```


### Run locally with ENV vars
[run_locally_with_env_vars.sh](examples/run_locally_with_env_vars.sh)

```sh
export GITHUB_ACTION=update_state
export GITHUB_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export GITHUB_OWNER=cloudposse
export GITHUB_REPO=github-status-updater
export GITHUB_REF=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export GITHUB_STATE=success
export GITHUB_CONTEXT="my-ci"
export GITHUB_DESCRIPTION="Commit status with target URL"
export GITHUB_TARGET_URL="https://my-ci.com/build/1"

./dist/bin/github-status-updater
```


After the above command is executed, the commit status will be updated to `success` with the target URL `https://my-ci.com/build/1` (the green check mark in the image below)

        -e GITHUB_TOKEN \
        -e GITHUB_OWNER \
        -e GITHUB_REPO \
        -e GITHUB_REF \
        -e GITHUB_STATE \
        -e GITHUB_CONTEXT \

```

## GitHub Required Status Checks


The module can be used to update required status checks for Pull Requests.

This is useful for CI environments to set build statuses with URLs to the build pages.

First, repository administrators need to enforce the branch protection and required status checks before a branch is merged in a pull request or before commits on a local branch can be pushed to the protected remote branch.

* https://help.github.com/articles/enabling-required-status-checks


![GitHub Branch Protection Settings](images/github-branch-protection-settings.png)


Then, to add `my-ci` as a status check for branch `test` of the `github-status-updater` repo, execute the `update_branch_protection` action locally

```ssh
./dist/bin/github-status-updater \
        -action update_branch_protection \
        -token XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
        -owner cloudposse \
        -repo github-status-updater \
        -ref test \
        -context my-ci
```


or in a Docker container

```ssh
docker run -i --rm \
        -e GITHUB_ACTION=update_branch_protection \
        -e GITHUB_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
        -e GITHUB_OWNER=cloudposse \
        -e GITHUB_REPO=github-status-updater \
        -e GITHUB_REF=test \
        -e GITHUB_CONTEXT="my-ci" \
        github-status-updater
```


After the command executes, status check `my-ci` will be enabled for the branch as shown in the image below

###
![GitHub Branch Protection Settings](images/github-branch-protection-update.png)
###


When you create a pull request for the branch, `my-ci` gets a notification from GitHub, starts the build, and updates the build status to `pending`
by executing the following command to update the status of the last commit (`ref XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`)

```sh
./dist/bin/github-status-updater \
        -action update_state \
        -token XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
        -owner cloudposse \
        -repo github-status-updater \
        -ref XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
        -state pending \
        -context "my-ci" \
        -description "still building..." \
        -url "https://my-ci.com/build/1"
```

###
![GitHub Status Check Pending](images/github-status-check-pending.png)
###


In case of any build errors, `my-ci` updates the build status to `error` with the error message in the `description` parameter

```sh
./dist/bin/github-status-updater \
        -action update_state \
        -token XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
        -owner cloudposse \
        -repo github-status-updater \
        -ref XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
        -state error \
        -context "my-ci" \
        -description "build error" \
        -url "https://my-ci.com/build/1"
```


###
![GitHub Status Check Error](images/github-status-check-error.png)
###


When the build succeeds, `my-ci` updates the build status to `success`

```sh
./dist/bin/github-status-updater \
        -action update_state \
        -token XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
        -owner cloudposse \
        -repo github-status-updater \
        -ref XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
        -state success \
        -context "my-ci" \
        -description "build completed" \
        -url "https://my-ci.com/build/1"
```

## Integrating with [CodeFresh](https://codefresh.io) CI/CD Pipelines

`github-status-updater` can be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines, especially those that use containers for build steps.

[codefresh.yml](examples/codefresh.yml) shows a complete example of a [CodeFresh](https://docs.codefresh.io/docs/introduction-to-codefresh-pipelines) pipeline which performs the following steps:

* Builds a Docker image for the application
* Builds a [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) [chart](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts)
* Pushes the Docker images (for commits, branches and tags) to CodeFresh repository
* Executes `update_branch_protection` action on `github-status-updater` [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudposse/github-status-updater) to add `Staging Environment` as a required status check
* Executes `update_state` action on `github-status-updater` [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudposse/github-status-updater) to update `Staging Environment` deployment status to `pending`
* Deploys the Helm chart to a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster
* Executes `update_state` action on `github-status-updater` [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudposse/github-status-updater) to update `Staging Environment` deployment status to `success`
